This repository highlights my top projects from a 13-week course on Predictive Analysis using Python. Each project demonstrates key skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and evaluation across regression, classification, and time series forecasting tasks.

Marketing Campaign Response Prediction (Week 9)
Description: This project analyzes customer data to predict marketing campaign responses using machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The dataset is cleaned, features are engineered, and key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated to evaluate model effectiveness.
Key Skills: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression, SVM, Model Evaluation, Data Visualization (Seaborn/Matplotlib).

Nashville Housing Price Prediction (Week 10)
Description: Predicts housing sale prices using regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Model performance is compared using metrics like MSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores. Visualizations help compare model effectiveness.
Key Skills: Regression Modeling, Model Comparison, Data Imputation, Feature Engineering, Metrics Evaluation, Data Visualization.

KNN and Neural Networks for Classification (Week 11)
Description: A classification task on letter recognition data using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network models. Data is standardized, models are trained and tested, and performance is evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
Key Skills: Classification, KNN, Neural Networks, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation.

Sales Forecasting Using SARIMAX (Week 13)
Description: Time series forecasting for monthly vehicle sales data using SARIMAX models. Includes analysis for "New" and "Used" sales, future forecasting, and performance evaluation using MAE and MSE. Extended forecasts for 60 months are visualized.
Key Skills: Time Series Forecasting, SARIMAX, Data Merging, Model Validation, Data Visualization.
